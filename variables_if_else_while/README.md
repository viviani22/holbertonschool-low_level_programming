- [1-last_digit.c](https://github.com/viviani22/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/1-last_digit.c) C program that checks if the last digit of a number is greater than 5, lower than 6 but not 0, or 0.
- [2-print_alphabet.c](https://github.com/viviani22/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/2-print_alphabet.c) C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase.
- [3-print_alphabets.c](https://github.com/viviani22/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/3-print_alphabets.c) C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase, and then in uppercase.
- [4-print_alphabt.c](https://github.com/viviani22/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/4-print_alphabt.c) C program that prints the alphabet in lowercase except 'e' and 'q'.
- [5-print_numbers.c](https://github.com/viviani22/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/5-print_numbers.c)  C program that prints all single digit numbers of base 10 starting from 0.
- [6-print_numberz.c](https://github.com/viviani22/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/6-print_numberz.c)  Same as the previous but using putchar() instead.
- [7-print_tebahpla.c](https://github.com/viviani22/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/7-print_tebahpla.c) C program that prints the lowercase alphabet in reverse.
- [8-print_base16.c](https://github.com/viviani22/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/8-print_base16.c) C program that prints all the numbers of base 16 in lowercase.
- [9-print_comb.c](https://github.com/viviani22/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/9-print_comb.c) C program that prints all possible combinations of single-digit numbers.
- [100-print_comb3.c](https://github.com/viviani22/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/100-print_comb3.c) C program that prints all possible different combinations of two digits
- [101-print_comb4.c](https://github.com/viviani22/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/101-print_comb4.c) C program that prints all possible different combinations of three digits.
- [102-print_comb5.c](https://github.com/viviani22/holbertonschool-low_level_programming/blob/main/variables_if_else_while/102-print_comb5.c) C program that prints all possible combinations of two two-digit numbers.
